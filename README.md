# Hash-LSB

A repository for the implementations that outputs the Least Significant Bit (LSB) from hashes.

Available algorithm(s): `keccak_256`, `SHA256` .

## How can I use it?

Change the variables in the code (Default generates 1 Gbit - it takes a while). 

Run it with: `python3 name.py`, where `name.py` is the desired script file Ex: `python3 keccakgen.py`.
